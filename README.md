## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Use of semantic html.
- Use of css cutom properties for colors, It increased my code readibility.
- Starting with creating mobile version, makes web responsiveness design easier, as the challenges get more serious as the screen size start to decrease.
- Applying borderbox to all elements, made dealing with sizes and distances easier.
- Using flexbox, with flex-direction: column, made stacking objects on top of each other much more fluent.
- Usage of attribute selectors with the help of asterisk wildcard.
- Checked my html and css for erros using [https://validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org)


### Continued development

- I plan to learn and use SCSS in my next project, in order to reduce redundancy.
